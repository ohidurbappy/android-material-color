# Android Material Color

It's an awesome collection of android color for use in android app. Every time we start a new android project we are in great need of choosing colors. This collection contains a good amount of standard material colors for quick use.


## How to use:

Copy(download) the **material-colors.xml** file from the repository and paste it into the values folder in your android studio project and you are all set. Now go to any view and use it with any compatible types like **textcolor, background** etc.

## Color classes:
- standard colors: red,white,blue etc
- md_red
- md_pink
- md_purple
- md_deep_purple
- md_indigo
- md_blue
- md_light_blue
- md_cyan
- md_teal
- md_green
- md_light_green
- md_lime
- md_yellow
- md_amber
- md_orange
- md_deep_orange
- md_brown
- md_grey
- md_blue_grey

## Naming Convention
The naming convention of the color resources are easy to remember. It either starts with a standard color name or it has a naming like : **md_classname_intensityValue** where classname are like **red,green** and intensity may be **50,100,200,300** and so on.

## Contribute
I wish to add more colors to the list and want to convert all the standard colors from [w3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_trends.asp) in to xml format. You can also do it if you have enough time and make it easier for others to reuse it.
**Thanks**
